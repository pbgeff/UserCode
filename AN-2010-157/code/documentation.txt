Paul Geffert - June 29, 2010

This is brief documentation for the code used in work on alphaT in
N-jet and gamma+jets early data samples. 
This work is for CMS AN 2010/157 and is intended for inclusion in the
SUSY PAS.  The code here was used in Version 5 of the analysis note. 

The files "flat_maker_jets_v24" and "flat_maker_pho" are run on the initial datasets and create small ntuples with pre-selected
events.  "flat_maker_QCD_v9" does the same for the MC.  The file "alphaT_new" runs on these small ntuples and produces the plots for the analysis note.  

The code "inJSON.C" uses the good-run JSON file and creates a header file that contains a function to determine if a particular run and lumisection belong to the good-run list.  

For my initial datasets, I use a custom root ntuple (cfA
ntuple) in which the contents of the PAT objects have been stored for
offline analysis.  
For the photon data, I use the DBS samples

For the jet sample, I use 
http://positron.physics.ucsb.edu/cfA/JetMETTau_Run2010A-Jun9thReReco_v1_RECO_UCSB0221_v24/desc.html and Commissioning10-SD_JetMETTau-v9 (not documented online). 
For the MC, the webpage documenting the file that I use is http://positron.physics.ucsb.edu/cfA/QCD_Pt30-herwigjimmy_Summer09-MC_31X_V3_7TeV-v1_GEN-SIM-RECO_UCSB0161_v9/desc.html.
