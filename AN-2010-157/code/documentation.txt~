Paul Geffert - June 3, 2010

This is brief documentation for the code used in work on alphaT in
N-jet and gamma+jets early data samples. 
This work is for CMS AN 2010/XXX and is intended for inclusion in the
SUSY PAS.  

The files "flat_maker_jets" and "flat_maker_pho" are run on the
initial min-bias dataset and create small ntuples with pre-selected
events.  The file "alphaT_new" runs on these small ntuples and
produces the plots for the analysis note.  

For my initial min-bias dataset, I use a custom root ntuple (cfA
ntuple) in which the contents of the PAT objects have been stored for
offline analysis.  
For the data, the webpage documenting the cfA file that I use is http://positron.physics.ucsb.edu/cfA/MinimumBias_Commissioning10-PromptReco-v8_RECO_UCSB0164_v20/desc.html.
For the MC, the webpage documenting the cfA file that I use is http://positron.physics.ucsb.edu/cfA/MinBias_Spring10-START3X_V26A_356ReReco-v1_GEN-SIM-RECO_UCSB0162_v20/desc.html.
